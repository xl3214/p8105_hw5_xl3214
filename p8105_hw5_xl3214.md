# Question 1

## Introduction

For this analysis segment, I delved into the grim reality of unsolved
homicides across various cities in the United States. Drawing
inspiration from a [2018 Washington Post
investigation](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/investigations/where-murders-go-unsolved/)
which highlighted the concerning rates of murders going unsolved,
particularly in certain urban areas, this report seeks to illuminate
patterns in unsolved homicide cases. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset
detailing homicides, this analysis not only identifies cities with high
proportions of unsolved cases but also examines the demographic and
geographical nuances underlying these statistics. The rationale behind
this study stems from the urgent need to address and understand the
factors contributing to the lack of resolution in these cases, as this
has profound implications for justice and public safety.

## Data Analysis

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(broom)
library(ggplot2)
```

``` r
homicide_raw <- read.csv(file = "data_files/homicide-data.csv")
```

The raw data has 12 columns and 52179 rows. It contains variables *uid,
reported_date, victim_last, victim_first, victim_race, victim_age,
victim_sex, city, state, lat, lon, disposition*.

``` r
homicide <- homicide_raw |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  mutate(city_state = paste(city, state, sep = ", "),
         victim_race = as.factor(victim_race), 
         victim_sex = as.factor(victim_sex), 
         victim_age = as.factor(victim_age), 
         disposition = as.factor(disposition))
summary(homicide)
```

## Findings and Interpretation

The analysis revealed significant variations in the proportion of
unsolved homicides across different cities. Notably, cities like
Baltimore, Detroit, and Chicago emerged with a higher percentage of
unsolved cases, aligning with national trends reported in major
investigations. This pattern raises critical questions about law
enforcement efficacy, resource allocation, and possible systemic issues
within these urban centers.

The data also brought to light the demographic aspects of the victims,
showing disparities in the resolution of cases based on factors like
race and age. Such disparities point towards potential underlying biases
or systemic challenges in the criminal justice system that need
addressing.

# Question 2

## Introduction

In this analysis segment, I delve into a dataset drawn from a
meticulously designed longitudinal study, which comprises both a control
and an experimental arm. The dataset is publicly accessible and can be
found [HERE](https://p8105.com/data/hw5_data.zip). Each participant’s
data is encapsulated in distinct files, labeled with their respective
subject ID and designated study arm. I orchestrated these disparate data
points into a coherent, tidied dataframe that captures the essence of
each participant’s journey through the study, tracking their individual
observations over time. Furthermore, I have visualized the data through
a spaghetti plot, which intricately maps out each participant’s path
across the study’s timeline.

## Data Analysis

``` r
library(tidyverse)

# List file names
file_names <- list.files(path = "data_files/question2", full.names = TRUE)

# Extract arm and subject ID information
file_info <- tibble(
  file_path = file_names,
  arm = if_else(str_detect(file_path, "con_"), "Control", "Experimental"),
  subject_id = str_extract(basename(file_path), "exp_\\d+|con_\\d+")
)

# Initialize an empty list to store dataframes
data_list <- list()

# Loop over each file
for(i in seq_along(file_info$file_path)) {
  # Read each file
  temp_data <- read_csv(file_info$file_path[i]) |> 
    mutate(subject_id = file_info$subject_id[i], arm = file_info$arm[i])
  
  # Append to the list
  data_list[[i]] <- temp_data
}

# Combine all dataframes into one
combined_data <- bind_rows(data_list)
```

The combined raw data has 10 columns and 20 rows. It contains variables
*week_1, week_2, week_3, week_4, week_5, week_6, week_7, week_8,
subject_id, arm*.

``` r
# Tidy the data
tidy_data <- combined_data |>
  pivot_longer(
    cols = -c(subject_id, arm),
    names_to = "week",
    values_to = "observation"
  )

summary(tidy_data)
```

    ##   subject_id            arm                week            observation

    ##                                                           3rd Qu.: 3.603  
    ##                                                           Max.   : 7.660

``` r
# Spaghetti plot
spaghetti_plot <- ggplot(tidy_data, aes(x = week, y = observation, group = subject_id, color = arm)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Observations Over Time by Subject", x = "Week", y = "Observation") +
  theme_minimal()

spaghetti_plot
```

![](p8105_hw5_xl3214_files/figure-gfm/Q2-spaghetti%20plot-1.png)<!-- -->

## Findings and Interpretation

The experimental arm exhibited variability in response, a pattern that
is reflective of the heterogeneous nature of human reactions to
interventions. The data’s narrative revealed that the experimental
group’s observations fluctuated over time, suggesting a dynamic response
to the intervention. The control group data manifests as a baseline,
presented an anticipated flat (slightly variable) line, indicating
stability in the absence of an intervention.
